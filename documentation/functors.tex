\subsubsection{\textit{Functor} (concept)}
A \textit{Functor} is a \texttt{struct} type     providing a constant
\texttt{operator()}. That operator shall be qualified as     \texttt{
noexcept} if possible and shall be qualified as    \texttt{constexpr}
if possible. The return type of \texttt{operator()} shall be of  type
\texttt{result} (or a cv-qualified variant of that). The      functor
shall provide the member type definition        \texttt{result\_type}
denoting the type \texttt{result}.\newline

Its \texttt{operator()} has $n$ parameters            $\texttt{x}_0$,
$\texttt{x}_1$, $\ldots$, $\texttt{x}_{n-1}$. The type of the $i$-th
parameter is $\texttt{X}_i$ (or a cv-qualified variant of $\texttt{X
}_i$). $n$ is called the arity of the functor.\newline

The functor shall provide the member constant expression     constant
\texttt{arity} of type \texttt{size\_t} denoting the arity         of
the functor.\newline

The functor shall provide a member type                     definition
$\texttt{operand\_type\_\textit{i}}$ denoting the type  $\texttt{X}_i$
of the $i$-th parameter.

\subsubsection{\textit{FunctorBase} (concept)}
A \textit{FunctorBase} is a template \texttt{struct} type. A  \textit{
FunctorBase} type may be a \textit{Functor}. The last         template
parameter of a \textit{FunctorBase} shall be \texttt{ENABLED}     with
the defaut  value \texttt{void}. Specializations may               use
\texttt{ENABLED} to perform SFINAE.Its partial specializations     are
\textit{Functors}.
